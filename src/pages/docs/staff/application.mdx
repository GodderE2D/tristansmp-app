# Application procedure

_This page is relevant only to staff members, but it may be useful to you for development or just to feed your curiosity._

New players can open applications on https://tristansmp.com/onboarding. If successful, a new application channel will appear and you will be pinged in you have the Review Ping role.

Currently, our acceptance criteria is quite loose. If applicants provide **all of the below information**, they should be accepted (with exceptions). If not all information are accepted, you should follow-up and ask them for additional details.

- Their reason for joining is overall positive and reasonable in length (no "im bored").
- They outline how long they will play, either in total (e.g. "for two months") or per-day/week (e.g. "every day").
- They explain how they can contribute to the server (e.g. more shops/farms at spawn, helping other members).

Don't feel pressured to accept the application if you deem them suspicious.

To accept an application, click the "Accept" button. If it doesn't work the first attempt, click it again until it works. The same goes for denying with the "Deny" button.

Unless you are Tristan, you should remain unbiased and not accept members just because you know them.
