## How do I contact them?

> **You must have Discord to contact the Staff team whenever, otherwise you will only be able to private message them when they are online on tristansmp.com**

## In-Game

You can simply just press **t** _(the default Minecraft key-bind to open chat)_ and ask, if you want to talk privately firstly you need to find a Staff Member by holding **tab** and looking for a username that starts with the prefix **\[STAFF\]** and then typing **/msg \<username\> hey this guy is griefing me** for example please make sure to remove **\<username\>** with an actual staff members username like **/msg nailayaa hi** for example

![screenshot of what the [STAFF] prefix looks like in game](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/885135206435151872/903920408514945034/unknown.png)

## Via [Discord](https://discord.gg/Nbdfw6MA2S)

## Staff Commands

> Fyi: these commands can only be run by our staff team

### **Application Procedure ( All Staff )**

New application people will create a new ticket and ask if they can have it reviewed.

Your job is to find it in **#applications** and review it then if you like it use these commands in order

```
?acc
?da @pingthem
```

Make sure to run these commands in the ticket, also if the application is bad don't say they are denied, just ask them to expand and if they are still "sus" or not giving a good enough answer tell them to redo the application and run the command

```
$close
```

### **Discord Commands** ( Only for Discord Staff)

**$close** - closes the ticket (use this when it was important like a punishment appeal)

**$delete** - Deletes the ticket (use this one when the ticket is not important as an application review)

**?mute @pinguser 10m spamming** - Mutes the pinged person for set time and reason

\#logs and #staff-logs - logs legit everything (very useful)
