## Contacting staff members

If your issue isn't directly related to a staff member, you should open a ticket instead. You can open a ticket in the #info channel in the [Discord server](https://tristansmp.com/discord).

Otherwise, you can contact a staff member directly by sending them a DM on Discord.

If they're online in-game, you can also privately message them using `/w <staff's username> <your message>` in-game. For example, if you wanted to privately message tristan, you can use `/w twisttaan Someone stole items from my chest` if they're online.
