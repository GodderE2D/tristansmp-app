# Punishments

_This page is relevant only to staff members, but it may be useful to you for development or just to feed your curiosity._

## Member-reported

If a player wants to report another member because they are breaking the rules, you should advise them to open a ticket. Tickets can be opened in the #info channel in the Discord server.

Let the reporter explain why the member is breaking the rules and include evidence (e.g. a screenshot from `/co i`, Discord link). Confirm the evidence and if the member actually broke the rules.

## Confirming evidence

To confirm evidence from Minecraft chat messages, you can check the #chat-link channel.

<!-- TODO: Whisper -->
To confirm evidence from Minecraft private messages (whispers), (WIP).

To confirm evidence from stealing/griefing from Minecraft, you can use `/co i` or `/co lookup` in-game. See the [CoreProtect page](/docs/staff/coreprotect) for more information.

To confirm evidence from the Discord server, ask touhem to provide a Discord message link. If they provided a screenshot, you can use the Discord search function (`Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `F`) to search for the message.

You cannot confirm evidence from Discord DMs effectively. Obviously, if it looks fake then don't accept it. If you cannot determine the legitimacy of a DM screenshot, you should advise them to block the member.

## Usual punishments

Staff members can still excercise discretion when issuing punishments.
