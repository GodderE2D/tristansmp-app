# TristanSMP Market

An alternate way to trading items from in-game shops is to use the TristanSMP **online market**. The market allows every item to be in a centralised place. Additionally, this makes stock easier to track and prevents stealing.

## Shulker boxes

Uncoloured shulker boxes will show its contents, while coloured shulker boxes will not. This allows players to create mystery boxes.

## In-game commands

- `/package <price in diamonds>` - Sell the item you're holding onto the market (cannot be bought back by yourself)
- `/deliver` - Deliver items in-transit to your inventory or withdraw all of your diamonds into your inventory if there are no items in transit
- `/deposit` - Deposit the number of diamonds you're holding into your market balance (this can also be a way to store your diamonds safely)
